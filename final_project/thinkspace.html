      I collect shotglasses.
    </div>
    <img class="floated-right" alt="Tequila Shotglass" src="../static/tequila_shotglass.png" width=50%>
    <br>
    <div>
      Over the course of my life, I have collected about 80 shotglasses! 
      They come from places I've traveled
      and snapshot great times with great people.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div>
      But my 80-some shotglasses are getting more and more unwieldy to transport and display.
      
      For my final project, I'd like to build a structure that can:
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li><b class="blue">Display</b> My Shotglasses</li> AND/OR
        <li>Help <b class="blue">Transport</b> My Shotglasses</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
      <div class="subsubhead">
        Ideal Features
      </div>

      <ol>
        <li><b class="blue">Scalability/Modular Design:</b> 
          Ideally, my design would be composed of many modules which I could
          combine and rearrange in order to scale up or down how many shotglasses
          I wanted to display or transport, or simply to modify for aesthetics 
          or different environments.
        </li> 

        <li><b class="blue">Protective:</b> 
          This structure should make it easy to move my shotglasses between home and campus,
          as well as protect shotglasses on display.
        </li> 

        <li><b class="blue">Separation:</b> 
          Most shotglasses are made of glass or similarly fragile materials. 
          It is best, then, for each shotglass to be displayed and/or transported
          separately, which likely means creating many "compartments."
        </li> 

        <li><b class="blue">Flexibility/Adjustability for Shotglass Sizing:</b> 
          While most shotglasses are the same size, I have many many irregular shotglass shapes and sizes.
          Ideally my structure would allow for many different kinds of shotglasses.
          That means the structure I make must be very adjustable either 
          post-creation -- I can adjust a compartment to be taller or shorter, say --
          or pre-creation -- use template designs that are easy to customize for
          each of my shotglasses.          
        </li> 

        <li><b class="blue">Indexing + Automation:</b> 
          As a stretch goal, and to incorporate microcontroller programming and add a lil something special
          to my project, I would love to be able to use a screen to select a specific 
          shotglass to either <mark>highlight</mark> or physically bring to the front.
          
          This would involve accurate indexing and labeling of my shotglasses, as well
          as connection of the Arduino or ESP32 to lights/motors.
        </li> 

        <li><b class="blue">Dust-Proof:</b> 
          A covered structure would help keep shotglasses dust-free.
        </li> 

        <li><b class="blue">Easy Access:</b> 
          Since I'd like to use my shotglasses from time to time and add new ones,
          I want a structure that makes it easy to reach each of my shotglasses.
        </li> 
        
      </ol>
    </div>

      What Already Exists
    </div>

    <div>
      Since the overarching goal is to display/transport my shotglasses,
      I have a lot of flexibility in terms of building a structure to 
      accomplish that goal.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div>
      Let's begin by looking at what kinds of shotglass displays and storage options are already out there!
    </div>
    <div>
      <a class="floated-left" href="https://www.displays2go.com/P-23539/Shot-Glass-Shelves-with-Silver-Standoffs"><img src="./shotglass_shelf.jpg" width=50%></a>
      <div>
        This 24 shot glass display case is available from Displays2Go for $115.
        This seems:
        <ol>
          <li><b>expensive:</b> $115 to hold less than a third of my shotglass collection
          is certainly not worth it.</li>
          <li><b>difficult to transport:</b> The display itself is large enough that it seems harvard
            to transport and not protective for transporting shotglasses.</li>
          <li><b>not easy access:</b> Since shotglasses are placed in the middle of the shelves, they're hard to reach.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>

    <br>
    <br>

    <div>
      <a class="floated-left" href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/776707887/custom-mountain-shelf-shot-glass-display"><img src="https://i.etsystatic.com/21624256/r/il/725f72/2469540747/il_1588xN.2469540747_5ze7.jpg" width=50%></a>
      <div>
        This shelf can hold 30, available on Etsy for $155+.
      </div>
      <div>
        <iframe width="560" height="315"

      </iframe>
      This shelf is pretty simple, but lights up!

        Possible Structures and Approaches
      </div>

      <img class="floated-right" alt="Sketch of Cylinder-Style Project" src="../01_intro/project_cylinders.png" width=50%>

      <ol>
        <li><b class="blue">Revolving Cake-style Tiers:</b> 
          Create several circle layers that revolve, and can bring one shotglass on any layer to the front.
        </li> 
        <li><b class="blue">Lit:</b> 
          Illuminate either all layers, and/or specific layers, and/or specific shotglasses.
        </li>
        <li><b class="blue">Latched, Clamping, Protective Spheres:</b> 
          Cast-mold or 3D print spheres that are netted/materialed with some give such that help protect
          whatever's inside. 

          Half-and half spheres that swivel and can latch closed.

          Include adjustable clamps

          This is my favorite approach, but it seems really difficult to scale up to 80+ shotglasses.
